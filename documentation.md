# Documentation

## General tips

Examples and public modules should contain documentation.

Links on the Terraform Registry are relevant and will not work, so use absolute path.

Include diagrams \(mermaid\)

Include nice blueprints by [cloudcraft.co](https://cloudcraft.co) 

## Automatically generated documentation

Using [Terraform pre-commit](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) hooks you can get documentation for your Terraform code up-to-date.
