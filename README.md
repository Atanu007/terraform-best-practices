# Introduction

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a fairy new project \(as most of DevOps tools actually\) which was started in 2014.

Terraform is powerful \(if not the most powerful out there now\) and one of the most used tool which allows to manage infrastructure as code. It allows developers to do a lot of things and does not restrict them from doing things in ways which will be hard to support or integrate with.

Some information described in this book may not seem like the best practices. I know this, and to help reader to separate what are established best practices and what is just another opinionated way of doing things, I use hints to provide some context and icons to specify the level of maturity on each subsection related to best practices.
